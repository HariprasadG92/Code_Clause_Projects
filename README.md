1) Music Player: A basic music player application that allows users to create a playlist by adding audio files and control the playback of those files using buttons for play, 
                 pause, resume, next, and previous actions. The application provides a simple graphical interface for interacting with the playlist and managing music playback 
                 using the Tkinter and Pygame libraries.

2) Text Editor:  A basic text editor application that allows users to perform common text editing tasks such as creating, opening, editing, and saving text files. It offers 
                 basic font and styling options, word and line count functionality, and the ability to toggle between dark and light themes for the text area. The 
                 application's interface is built using the Tkinter library, providing a simple way to interact with and manipulate text content.
